//! The singleton global registry object. the server has a number of global objects
//! that are available to all clients. these objects typically represent an actual
//! object in the server (for example, an input device) or they are singleton
//! objects that provide extension functionality. when a client creates a registry
//! object, the registry object will emit a global event for each global currently
//! in the registry. globals come and go as a result of device or monitor hotplugs,
//! reconfiguration or other events, and the registry will send out global and
//! global_remove events to keep the client up to date with the changes. to mark the
//! end of the initial burst of events, the client can use the wl_display.sync
//! request immediately after calling wl_display.get_registry. a client can bind to
//! a global object by using the bind request. this creates a client-side handle
//! that lets the object emit events to the client and lets the client invoke
//! requests on the object.
